Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
    The vulnerability is related to Privilege Escalation. This issue arises because the application does not properly authenticate and authorize the user making the request to update user roles. The application checks if the user whose role is to be updated is an admin but does not verify if the requester has the authority to make such changes. This allows an authenticated user to potentially change their role to an admin by simply knowing the user ID and manipulating the request, leading to unauthorized access and control.
    The "secure" version introduces session-based authentication and authorization to prevent the privilege escalation vulnerability. By using sessions, the application can track authenticated users and their roles across multiple requests. This way, the application does not rely solely on the user-supplied data in the request body to determine if a user is authorized to update roles. Instead, it checks if the user is logged in (authenticated) and if the logged-in user's session indicates they have an admin role (authorization). This effectively prevents unauthorized users from escalating their privileges.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
    1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement a more granular RBAC system that defines permissions not just at the role level but also at the level of individual actions or resources. This ensures users can only perform actions allowed by their roles.
    2. Strong Authentication Mechanisms: Use multifactor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security when users log in. This helps ensure that the person performing sensitive actions is indeed the authorized user.
    3. Audit Logging: Keep detailed logs of sensitive actions, including who performed the action, what was changed, and when. This can help in detecting unauthorized access or modifications and in investigating security incidents.
